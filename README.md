# SealCleanUp

This code/ workflow has been created to check nutrient data generated from analysis using the AQ400 in the Reisinger lab at UF. Its primary functions include:
1) Reformatting of sample names by splittig up the names used in analysis into their three main components - site name, rep, and collection date; 
2) Checking the quality of sample blanks and CCV samples to ensure quality of analyses; 
3) Checking if there was any drift in the calibration standards during the sample analysis process and applying any drift corrections when necessary; and 
4) Moving drift verified and/or drift corrected data into a centralized database
